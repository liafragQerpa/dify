The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and was voted the best Serbian movie made in the 1947â1995 period by the Yugoslav Board of the Academy of Film Art and Science. The film is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Yugoslav cinema and a cult classic in Serbia.
 
The film opens with the signature song Za Beograd (For Belgrade), sung by two Romani youths into the camera. The song continues throughout the film as a leitmotif for the doomed journey of the travelers. The film follows the adventures and misfortunes of a colorful group of random passengers on a dilapidated bus, owned by KrstiÄ Sr. and driven by his impressionable and dim-witted son MiÅ¡ko. Along the way, they are joined by a priest and a pair of young newlyweds who are on their way to the seaside for their honeymoon.
 
The travelers are faced with numerous difficulties: an army roadblock forcing a detour, a farmer ploughing the road which, he claims, stretches over his land, a flat tire, a funeral, two feuding families, a shaky bridge, KrstiÄ Jr.'s recruitment into the army, and a lost wallet. All these slow the bus down and expose rifts among the travelers. During the early morning of Sunday, 6 April, amid rumours of war, they finally reach Belgrade only to be caught in the middle of the Luftwaffe raid (Operation Punishment). The only apparent surviving passengers are the two Romani musicians who sing the film's theme song before the end.
 
Ko to tamo peva is a film that combines humor and tragedy, satire and realism, nostalgia and criticism. It depicts the absurdity and futility of war, the fragility and diversity of human life, and the beauty and tragedy of Yugoslav history and culture.

The film is full of memorable characters and scenes that have become iconic in Serbian culture. Some of the most famous ones are:
 
- The World War I veteran who constantly repeats "I was at the Salonica Front" and claims to have a premonition of war.
- The Germanophile who praises Hitler and tries to convince the others that Germany is their friend.
- The budding singer who dreams of becoming a star and sings patriotic songs.
- The sickly looking man who coughs blood and reveals that he has tuberculosis.
- The hunter with a shotgun who shoots at anything that moves and causes trouble.
- The priest who blesses the bus and tries to calm down the passengers.
- The newlyweds who are eager to consummate their marriage and are constantly interrupted by the others.
- The two Romani musicians who provide the soundtrack for the film and comment on the events with their songs.

The film also features many references and allusions to Yugoslav history, culture, and politics. For example, the date of the film coincides with the date of the CvetkoviÄ-MaÄek Agreement, which created the autonomous Banovina of Croatia within Yugoslavia and was seen by many Serbs as a betrayal. The film also foreshadows the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars that followed in the 1990s. The film's ending is a powerful metaphor for the destruction of Yugoslavia and its people by external forces.
 
Ko to tamo peva is a film that transcends its time and place and speaks to universal themes of human nature, war, and history. It is a film that makes you laugh and cry, think and feel, remember and imagine. It is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone who loves cinema and humanity.
