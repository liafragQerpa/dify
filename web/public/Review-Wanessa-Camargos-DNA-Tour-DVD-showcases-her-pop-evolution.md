Wanessa Camargo was born on December 28, 1982, in GoiÃ¢nia, GoiÃ¡s, Brazil. She is the daughter of the famous sertanejo singer ZezÃ© Di Camargo and the businesswoman ZilÃº GodÃ³i. She grew up in a musical environment and started singing at an early age. She attended public schools and faced financial difficulties during her childhood.
 
She moved to SÃ£o Paulo in 1991, when her father and uncle Luciano Camargo formed the successful duo ZezÃ© Di Camargo & Luciano. She was influenced by their music and also by pop artists like Madonna, Mariah Carey and Britney Spears. She decided to pursue a career as a singer and signed with BMG in 2000.
 
She released her first album, Wanessa Camargo, in 2000, followed by two more albums with the same name in 2001 and 2002. Her music was mainly country-pop and she had hits like "O Amor nÃ£o Deixa", "Enamorado por VocÃª" and "Sem Querer". She also worked as a TV presenter and actress during this period.
  
Wanessa Camargo has released nine studio albums, two live albums, three extended plays, 38 singles and two DVDs in her career. She has sold over 3 million records and received several awards and nominations, including two Latin Grammy nominations.
 
Her discography reflects her musical evolution and experimentation with different genres and languages. She started with a country-pop style in her first three albums, Wanessa Camargo (2000), Wanessa Camargo (2001) and Wanessa Camargo (2002), which featured hits like "O Amor nÃ£o Deixa", "Enamorado por VocÃª" and "Sem Querer".
 
She then shifted to a dance-pop sound in her fourth album, W (2005), which included songs like "Amor, Amor" and "NÃ£o Resisto a NÃ³s Dois". She also released her first live album and DVD, Transparente Ao Vivo (2004), which sold 200,000 copies.
